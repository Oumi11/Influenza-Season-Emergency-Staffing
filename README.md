### Creation of a staffing plan for influenza season in the US
#### This project was completed as part of the curriculum from the CareerFoundry bootcamp.

## Introduction
### The United States has an influenza season where more people than usual suffer from the flu. Some people, particularly those in vulnerable populations, develop serious complications and end up in the hospital. Hospitals and clinics need additional staff to adequately treat these extra patients. The medical staffing agency provides this temporary staff.

## Objective & Scope
### This analysis aims to optimize staffing decisions by determining when and how many healthcare workers to deploy across U.S. states. The agency provides supplemental staff to hospitals in all 50 states, with a focus on planning for the next influenza season.
